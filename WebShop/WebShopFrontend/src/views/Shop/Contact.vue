                    Welcome to our project! It is a pleasure to have you here, in our site.
                    We, the three founding developers of this project wish you to have a great time
                    during your visit. But first let us tell a few things about ourselves.
                </p>

                <p class="text-m" style="text-align: center;">
                    This WebShopProject or project NASAPC in other names started out as a school project which
                    we turned in as a requirement for the last exam we had to complete in order to successfully
                    finish the Software Developer and Tester educational course which we participated in.
                </p>
                <p class="text-m" style="text-align: center;"> 
                    This course provided us a two-year long educational training which is by the way fully recognised by
                    the Hungarian government and hosted by the country's one of the most famous if not the most famous secondary technical schools
                    which is qualified to teach this subject.
                </p>
